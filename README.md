# Electronic-Lead-Screw
Replacement for the mechanical gearbox of a lathe with an electronic gearbox to allow for instant gear ratio changes similar to a project done by [Clough42](https://github.com/clough42/electronic-leadscrew).

My implementation of this project uses a [LAUNCHXL-F280049C](https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruii7b/spruii7b.pdf?ts=1707211745040&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Ftool%252FLAUNCHXL-F280049C) (code in main.c) as the brains of the project, and an Arduino nano (code in Arduino code.ino) to run the UI.

The majority of the code is currently uncommented as this is a first revision and further updates and overhauls are planned in the near future.
